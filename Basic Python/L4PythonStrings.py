#Concatenating Python strings
# When you place the string literals next to each other,
# Python automatically concatenates them into one string. For example:


# greeting = 'Good ' 'Morning!'
# print(greeting)
#
# Python strings are immutable.
# It means that you cannot change the string.
# For example, youâ€™ll get an error if you update one or more characters in a string:
#


str1 = "Python String"
str1[0] = 'J'
print(str1)

# # @Python strings are immutable
#
# str1 = "Python String"
# str1 = 'J' + str1[1:]
# print(str1)
